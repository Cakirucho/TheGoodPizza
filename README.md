## Project build by Samuel Villaescusa Vinader(samuelvv22@gmail.com)

### How to build project

 - Build in Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS
 - Using Ruby 2.3.1 version.
 - Rails 5.1.4 version

 Steps to run project:
  - Need to install all the esentials for rails (nodejs, libxml2 etc)
  - Also mysql needed -> `gem install mysql2`

Then run the server using `spring` --> `bundle exec spring rails server`

You should have it running in `localhost:3000`

PD: I have build a deployment script, but don't know if it will work, because
    i built it pretty fast to start the project.
